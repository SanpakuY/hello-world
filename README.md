Hello, World!

If you are reading this, hope you are having a great day!

My name is Yoshitsune Ito, and this is my github page.

I am an amateur programmer and this page will mostly be used for my personal projects and/or learning projects.

That's all I'll write for now, maybe someday more will be written here, but until then.

Goodbye, World!
